# Books Read By Felipe

This project is not really a project. It's more like a smart way to use Git to read books and bookmark, take notes and keep track of things correctly.

The reason for this is mainly because I kept losing track of where I was and bookmark apps have proved unreliable to me up to this point.

This may become my go to way to track progress and who knows even give me ideas for a new cool Django app.
